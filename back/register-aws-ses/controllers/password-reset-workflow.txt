How password reset works ?

user will enter email address
you will find that user based on email address from db
if found, you will create password reset code
then you will save that code in db and also send to that user's email
if this is the correct user, he will have access to his email
he can copy that code and paste in the form, enter new password then hit submit
on submit, our server will receive the user's email and code
you will try to find the user based on the email and code
if found, update his old password with new one and reset code back to empty
done
